# YearsGone
Step into the life of a bitter old man, left behind in his isolation. Explore the desolate apartment he calls home, devoid of any life and color, as he lives out the rest of his days. Interact with and inspect objects to recall memories of days long past, reminiscing about the happy memories as well as the regrets.

This is an assignment for Narrative Design course. Focus on environmental story telling and world building. Made with Unity on a team of 3.
